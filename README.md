# Percival : The HolyC Compiler

A direct port of the HolyC Compiler to Rust direct from Terry Davis.

## Disclaimer
Although it was all fun and games to make fun of Terry Davis when he was alive, I personally believe that the internet had the chance to save a man and instead opted to make fun of, belittle, and fuel this mentally ill man until he took his own life. As such, I only wish this project to extend the great work Terry did with his language to an operating system other than TempleOS and leave out any jokes at the poor man's expense.

So, please, in memory of this great programmer, no glow in the dark jokes, racism, or anything else distasteful Terry may have endorsed due to his mentally ill state.

That being said, I believe one joke is in order, and in good taste:

All Hail King Terry, and rest in peace.
